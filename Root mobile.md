I am using a rooted pixel3l, for rooting tutorials check out YouTube, keyword twrp magisk.It took me a long time to finish because I made a lot of mistakes while root, 
but actually the root process is very simple. It just took me a long time to learn about it and I looked up a lot of information.Because of the Twrp version,the last version not support my phone,so waste too much time.
